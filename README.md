# ðŸ“¡ Geospatial Telecom Infrastructure Optimization

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Modern society relies on robust telecom infrastructure to stay connected. However, traditional tower planning is slow and leads to both over-served (wasteful) and under-served (excluded) regionsâ€”especially in rural or rapidly growing areas.

This project demonstrates how big data, machine learning, and geospatial analysis can modernize telecom tower planning for better digital inclusion and cost-efficiency.

Using the OpenCelliD dataset (millions of tower records), our solution:
- Cleans and preprocesses raw data
- Maps coverage and technology share
- Analyzes density and identifies coverage gaps
- Uses ML (K-Means) to suggest new tower sites
- Compares operator performance
- Provides interactive dashboards and detailed analytics for both business and technical audiences

The solution integrates Streamlit dashboards, PySpark/MapReduce scripts, and folium-based interactive maps.

### Detailed File Explanations

#### `app/streamlit_basic.py`
- Main Streamlit dashboard for tower analytics
- Lets users upload OpenCelliD-style CSV files
- Interactive graphs: technology share pie charts, operator breakdowns, location heatmaps
- Live CPU temperature simulation (demonstrates real-time features)
- "Get Insights" button leverages Google Gemini API for automated chart commentary
- Designed for exploratory analysis, not just ML

#### `app/streamlit_ml.py`
- Advanced Streamlit dashboard focused on predictive analytics
- Uses K-Means clustering to suggest optimal new tower sites based on coverage gaps
- Operator-wise and technology-wise clusteringâ€”finds best regions for expansion per operator/technology
- Interactive folium maps visualize current and recommended tower locations
- Allows scenario analysis by adjusting cluster count (number of new towers)

#### `app/tower_all_layers_map.html`
- Exported multi-layer interactive map (HTML, openable in any browser)
- Shows tower technologies, operator overlays, region statistics
- Great for sharing static visualizations outside Streamlit

#### `bigdata/mapreduce.py`
- Hadoop-style MapReduce script (PySpark RDDs) for analysis at scale
- Steps:
  - Loads and preprocesses dataset
  - Counts total towers and technologies
  - Computes towers per region (rounded lat/lon)
  - Aggregates by radio type, computes average range
  - Finds regions/towers with the most/least coverage
  - Identifies unique cell IDs, high-sample towers, and more
- CLI output: designed for learning, research, and rapid batch analytics

#### `bigdata/sparkan.py`
- Advanced analytics with PySpark DataFrames
- Performs:
  - Technology distribution and coverage
  - Region summary (tower count, avg range, avg samples)
  - Temporal analysis (towers by year, by technology)
  - Operator share breakdown
  - Finds under-served regions, top towers, and more
- Outputs rich summaries for dashboards, academic use, or further analysis

#### `bigdata/README.md`
- Instructions for running MapReduce and PySpark scripts (cluster or local mode)
- Troubleshooting tips for PySpark

#### `data/310.csv`
- Sample dataset (anonymized OpenCelliD format)
- Includes columns: radio, mcc, mnc, area, cell, lon, lat, range, samples, created, updated, etc.
- (Do not upload private or proprietary data to GitHub! For demonstration/sample use only.)

#### `requirements.txt`
- All dependencies for Streamlit apps and PySpark scripts
- See [Installation & Usage](#installation--usage) for details

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Streamlit** (dashboard/web app)
- **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn** (EDA, charts)
- **folium** (interactive mapping)
- **PySpark** (big data processing, DataFrames & RDDs)
- **scikit-learn** (K-Means clustering)
- **Google Gemini GenerativeAI API** (automated chart explanations)
- **OpenCelliD data** (or similar format)

## âš¡ Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-tower-analytics.git
cd telecom-tower-analytics
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up API secrets
For Google Gemini or other keys:

**Use Streamlit's secrets.toml:**
`app/.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```ini
GENAI_API_KEY = "your_google_genai_key"
```

**In code, access as:**
```python
import streamlit as st
key = st.secrets["GENAI_API_KEY"]
```

Or use `.env` and `os.environ`, but do not commit your secrets!

### 4. Run the dashboards
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_basic.py
# or
streamlit run app/streamlit_ml.py
```

### 5. Run Big Data scripts
```bash
cd bigdata
python sparkan.py      # PySpark advanced analytics
python mapreduce.py    # MapReduce demo
```

## ðŸ”‘ How Secrets and API Keys are Managed

- No API keys are ever hardcoded.
- Use `.env` (for local dev) or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` for cloud/Streamlit sharing.
- Both files are in `.gitignore` so secrets never leak.
- All code is written to securely load keys.

## ðŸ“ˆ Data

The main dataset (`310.csv`) uses OpenCelliD fields:
- `radio`, `mcc`, `mnc`, `area`, `cell`, `lon`, `lat`, `range`, `samples`, `created`, `updated`, etc.
- You may substitute your own data (with matching format).
- **Important:** Do not push or upload real user or proprietary data to public repositories.
